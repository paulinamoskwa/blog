Shortly after I moved to Tampere, in Finland, where for the first time in my life I experienced -25°C.\nI enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest research papers and experimenting with new models and frameworks whenever I can. In particular, I like to tease VLMs with optical illusions.\nCurrently delving into parallel programming, specifically GPU & CUDA.\n\n\n📍 Italian based in Finland 🎙️ We can talk in English, Italian, or Polish"
